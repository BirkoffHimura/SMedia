Please note this is a sample project to provide some code for reference for future employer, the project is missing some parts in the front-end like messaging, and both in the back-end and front-end like connections(friend requests). These will be added as a get some free time as I'm working on another projects at the moment.

In the config files specially in the test project, the paths might need to be modified, since the tests deploys the MVC project and creates test files during the tests. Also the test creates a test database 'SMediaTest'.

Backend test requirements
MS SQL Server

Frontend test Requirements
Google Chrome (Used with Selenium web driver)

If you get any issues please don't hesitate to contact me.
